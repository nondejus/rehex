# Reverse Engineer's Hex Editor

## What is this?

As the name implies, this is a hex editor. It aims to be a good general-purpose hex editor and to have a wide selection of features for analysing and annotating binary file formats.

It is still in early development and should be considered in beta state at the moment. Current features include:

* Large* file support
* Decoding of integer/floating point value types
* Disassembly of machine code
* Highlighting and annotation of ranges of bytes

\* I've gone up to 1TiB in cursory testing, but it should be able to go a lot higher... just in case you want to start editing big disk images.

## How can I run it?

If you're running Linux, just checkout the source and run `make`. You will need Jansson, wxWidgets and LLVM installed, along with their development packages (Install `build-essential`, `git`, `libwxgtk3.0-dev`, `libjansson-dev` and `llvm-dev` on Ubuntu).

If you're running Windows or OS X, the quickest way is to go to the commit history, follow a link to the relevant Buildkite job and download the binary from the artifacts tab.
